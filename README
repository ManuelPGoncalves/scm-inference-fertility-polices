**Evaluating the Impact of Fertility Policies in EU Countries: A Synthetic Control Method Approach**

**Context:**
Fertility rates in the European Union have been declining for decades, prompting many member states to introduce various, sometimes aggressive, pro-natalist policies aimed at attempting to reverse this trend. This trend also leads to various economic challenges since these countries operate on a capitalist market that is driven by peopleâ€™s consumption. Understanding the effectiveness of these policies is critical for designing strategies that can effectively address the demographic and challenges posed by declining fertility rates. This thesis aims to evaluate the impact of fertility policies in selected EU countries using the Synthetic Control Method (SCM).


**Research gap and objectives:**
The decline in fertility rates across the EU, despite various pro-natalist policies, highlights a gap in understanding their true effectiveness. While policies have been implemented, robust causal analyses of their short-, medium-, and long-term impacts are lacking. This research addresses that gap by using the Synthetic Control Method (SCM) to evaluate fertility policies in Hungary, Germany, and France. The study aims to answer: What are the causal effects of these policies on fertility rates? Can SCM offer credible insights for policy recommendations? The objectives are to assess policy effectiveness and provide actionable recommendations for the EU.


**Methodological approach:**
This study employs the Synthetic Control Method (SCM), a robust tool for causal inference in policy evaluation. SCM constructs a synthetic version of a treated country by combining control countries that were not exposed to the same fertility policies, allowing for a credible estimation of the policy's impact. The method uses fertility rates as the outcome variable, with predictor variables such as GDP per capita, unemployment rates, and female labour force participation. Data will be sourced from Eurostat, the OECD, and the World Bank. The estimated causal effects will be tested using placebo tests and robustness checks, ensuring the validity of the findings.


**Expected results and contributions:**
The expected results of this study are robust causal estimates of the impact of fertility policies in Hungary, Germany, and France on their respective fertility rates. By isolating the effects of these interventions, the research aims to reveal whether the policies led to significant changes compared to a synthetic control group. The study's 
contributions will include actionable insights for policymakers, offering evidence-based recommendations on which policies are most effective in addressing declining fertility rates. This research will also enhance the 
understanding of how SCM can be applied to policy evaluations in demographic studies.
